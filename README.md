- BLoC pattern for state management
- Dependency Injection for better testability and modularity
- [Add any specific features of your application]

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture principles, separating the codebase into layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components and BLoC classes
2. **Domain Layer**: Holds business logic and use cases
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data sources and repositories

## Testing

The project emphasizes Test-Driven Development. You'll find tests for:

- Unit tests for domain layer
- Unit tests for data layer
- Widget tests for presentation layer
- Integration tests

To run the tests:
flutter test
